# Visualizing Features From Data

The goal of this file is to get an idea of how the features are distributed between all 5 samples. 

## Analysis

```{r loading Data}
omanFT <- read.table(here::here("data/2018-11-23/QA_oman_feature_table.txt"), header = T,
                     stringsAsFactors = F)
dataCols <- 3:7
```

### Distribution

```{r}
as.matrix(omanFT[,dataCols]) %>% heatmap(main = "Feature Distribution Between Samples")
```

From this data, it seems like WAB.71 is the most different, folled by SHQ.14.

```{r}
overlapTable <- omanFT[,dataCols] %>% apply(2, function(x) {
    x > 0
})

vennDiagram(vennCounts(overlapTable), circle.col = brewer.pal(5, "Set1"))
rm(overlapTable)
```

The same pattern holds, and is not as big numerically as the heatmap makes it seem.

### Intensity Differences

Before doing a larger feature selection to integrate how intensity could contribute to differences between the samples selected, I need to try to give things chemical formulas. Hopefully I can use the formulas as predictors for a random forest later.  

```{r}
mOz <- omanFT$Neutral_Mass[order(omanFT$Neutral_Mass)]
abs_abu <- omanFT[order(omanFT$Neutral_Mass),dataCols] %>% apply(1, max)

formTable <- data.frame(mz = as.character(mOz), abs_abu = as.character(abs_abu), stringsAsFactors = F)
nonNaFormTable <- formTable[!is.na(formTable$mz),]

write.table(x = nonNaFormTable, row.names = F, sep = "\t",
            file = here::here("data/2018-11-24/formularity_table.txt"),
            quote = F)


```


Think about doing some kind of feature selection
